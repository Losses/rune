## Introduction

Rune Player is a music player that offers audio analysis and recommendation features. It introduces a new, modern music management paradigm to enhance your experience.

## Motivation

Rune is a UX experiment inspired by the question: What if Zune[^1] had continued to evolve? Using a modern tech stack (Flutter + Rust), Rune captures the essence of Zune, drawing from the design highlights of various Windows products since the Windows XP era, including Windows Mobile and Windows Media Center[^1].

The motivation behind Rune is to provide a modernized audio listening and management experience. With the rise of streaming services, localized music players have become less common, and many well-known media players have stagnated. Rune aims to offer a clean, consistent, and efficient audio playback experience.

## Unique Features

- **Distinctive Design**: Rune boasts a unique design style.
- **Audio Analysis and Recommendations**: Users can analyze their entire music library to receive recommendations based on tracks, albums, or playlists.
- **Dynamic "Mix" Feature**: Users can create dynamic playlists based on customizable rules, such as:

  - "Similar to this album"
  - "Top 100 most played tracks"
  - "Tracks similar to my favorites"
  - "Playlists including specific artists"

  These mixes automatically update as users listen to and add new tracks.

## Installation and Running

Rune is still in the early stages of development and does not provide pre-compiled binaries. However, you can set up a development environment by following the [compiling instructions](documents/compiling.md).
