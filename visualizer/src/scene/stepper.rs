//! The decisions of a song with a chart, stepped by song time.
//!
//! With a chart the scene's [`Decider`] is not stepped by the frames the screen draws but by the
//! song: every frame takes the steps of [`STEP`] whose song time has come (none at a high frame
//! rate, a few after a slow frame), each heard from the chart alone with the song's seed. The
//! cuts, looks and moments then come at the same song times, and are the same, whatever the frame
//! rate, and whenever the scene was opened.
//!
//! Where the song time jumps (the scene opens on a song under way, a seek) the decider is put
//! where it would be by playing the song from its start, silently: from the latest snapshot
//! before that time, which are kept every ten seconds of song from such replays and from playing
//! on untouched, else from the start. What it skipped is not played: the screen jumps to the
//! shot on, without a transition or an effect.
//!
//! A chart that comes while the scene plays (the analysis of the song finished) does not jump:
//! the song's decider is stepped next to the one on screen until it cuts, and the screen takes it
//! over on that cut. A scene without shots, or with a shot a lab holds, never cuts: there the
//! song's decider takes over at once.
